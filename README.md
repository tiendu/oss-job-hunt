# Open Source Job Hunting

> *"I don't just want a job. I want to build things that matter, with people who care."*

This is my public notebook for contributing to open-source projects to build trust, credibility, and collaboration with organizations whose **mission** I believe in. My goal is to get hired by doing meaningful, real work first - not just sending cold resumes.

I focus on companies and projects that are:
- **Social good-oriented** (public health, education, science)
- **Ethical tech** (open source, no surveillance capitalism)
- **Community-driven** (cooperatives, open governance, transparent funding)

Languages I work in: **Go**, **Rust**, **Python**, **TypeScript**, **Groovy**
Fields I engage with: **infra**, **open science**, **climate**, **public health**, **bio/data**

## Strategy Overview

1. **Find mission-aligned orgs** (not just profit-hungry ones)
2. **Identify open-source activity**
3. **Build context and relationships**
4. **Contribute code with care**
5. **Start conversations when trust is earned**
6. **Track everything in this repo**

## Example Targets

| Org/Project         | Field           | Notes                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------|
| OpenMRS             | Public Health   | Global health infrastructure          |
| Rust Foundation     | Infrastructure  | Empowering Rust ecosystem             |

## Project Structure

```
.
├── companies
│   └── bioinformatics
│       └── bioconductor.md
├── contributions
│   └── 2025-04-21_bioconductor-setup.md
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── templates
│   ├── company-profile.md
│   ├── contribution-log.md
│   └── outreach.md
└── tracking.md
```

## How to Use This

- Pick an org then fill out a profile using `templates/company-profile.md`
- Contribute then document it using `templates/contribution-log.md`
- Track your status in `tracking.md`
- Reach out when you've built value and trust

Let your open-source work **speak for you**.
