# Ethical Open Source Job Hunting

> *"I don't just want a job. I want to build things that matter, with people who care."*

This is my public notebook for contributing to open-source projects to build trust, credibility, and collaboration with organizations whose **mission** I believe in. My goal is to get hired by doing meaningful, real work first - not just sending cold resumes.

I focus on companies and projects that are:
- **Social good-oriented** (public health, education, science)
- **Ethical tech** (open source, no surveillance capitalism)
- **Community-driven** (cooperatives, open governance, transparent funding)

Languages I work in: **Go**, **Rust**, **Python**, **TypeScript**, **Groovy**
Fields I engage with: **infra**, **open science**, **climate**, **public health**, **bio/data**

## Strategy Overview

1. **Find mission-aligned orgs** (not just profit-hungry ones)
2. **Identify open-source activity**
3. **Build context and relationships**
4. **Contribute code with care**
5. **Start conversations when trust is earned**
6. **Track everything in this repo**
